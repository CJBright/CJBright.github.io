                                &emsp;I'm an academic researcher in computational fluid dynamics at the University of Manchester looking to pursue a career in computing.
                                I have a life-long love for tech and a recent buzz for programming - having discovered it through academia and growing to love it in my free time.
                                Through my degree I've proven my worth as an independent worker, but now I'm seeking an environment that encourages teamwork and supports opportunities to grow.
                                Away from the computer I have a passion for travel, a knack for languages, and an overall drive to learn!

                                &emsp;I grew up in a poor and ever-changing environment.
                                My computer became my stability - it held my academic achievements, personal interests, and was a gateway to my friends.
                                It also housed the magic of the internet, and I used it to try and learn many skills for free.
                                I tried my hand at music creation, 3D modelling, and a YouTube channel which brought lessons in digital art, photo and video editing, and graphic design.<br><br>
                                
                                &emsp;My education led me away from the more traditional, creative tasks that dominated my teens and towards advanced modelling and simulation as well as programming.
                                My computer remained a tool that I loved to learn about, tinker with, and squeeze every ounce of performance out of.
                                It has formed my interests, and I regularly spend my free time reading about the latest developments in computing and technology from multiple user perspectives.<br><br>
                                
                                &emsp;I discovered my passion for travel at university, where I funded my trips through the University of Manchester's student bursaries.
                                My first trip was to Sweden  for an esports tournament, meeting an online friend for the first time!
                                It was such a good time that I've since learned Swedish and regularly visit him and his family.
                                Through similar means I've also learned some Dutch and Russian.
                                I consider languages a very crucial for discovering and indulging a country's culture.
                                Today, I am looking for career opportunities world-wide.
                                I am ready to embrace a new environment and will try my very integrate and thrive.
