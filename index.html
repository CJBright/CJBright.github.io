                                &emsp;&emsp;I'm an academic researcher in computational fluid dynamics at the University of Manchester.
                                I have a life-long love for technology and a recent buzz for programming!
                                Having discovered it through academia, I've grown to love it in my free time and now I am looking to pursue a career in it.
                                Through my degree I've proven my worth as an independent worker, but I seek an stimulating environment that encourages teamwork and supports opportunities to develop and grow.
                                Away from the computer I'm very social, with a passion for travel, a knack for languages.

                                &emsp;&emsp;I've been a computer power-user since I was a teen.
                                I was fascinated by each component, how it functions, and how I apply my PC as a tool across many fields.
                                I used free online tutorials to learn a range of skills: music creation, 3D modelling, digital art, photo & video editing, and graphic design.
                                I put them into practice on a YouTube channel, chasing a dream to become a VFX artist - what better excuse to always have the best rig?!
                                At University, I was introduced to exciting new tools for modelling, simulation, and programming which most of my time is now spent with.
                                Today, I still enjoy reading about the latest developments in computing and tech.

                                &emsp;&emsp;My love for travel is much more recent.
                                I funded my first solo trip in 2015 using a student bursary (not too wise).
                                With a new-found confidence, I went to Sweden to meet a gaming friend for an esports competition!
                                Other online friends taught me Swedish, which I still practice & speak today.
                                Similarly, gaming has taught me Dutch and Russian and taken me to many more countries.
                                Since then, I've grown to appreciate the different cultures, histories, people in a new light.
                                I'm searching for global opportunities for employment, scratching the itch to experience something new.
