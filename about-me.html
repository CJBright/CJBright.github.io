                </h2>
                <p class="body-text">My favourite pastime is exploration and travel.<br>
                    I most enjoy becoming fully immersed into the culture and language of each region to understand and embrace its uniquiness. <br>
                    This has led me to learn Swedish at an intermediate level (previously fluent) and beginner Norwegian, Dutch, and Russian!

                </h2>
                <p class="body-text">Surprisingly, my experience with video-games inspired my love for travel. <br>
                    Beginning as a way to visit distant teammates and progressing into attending tournaments, video games have taken me to Sweden, Norway, and Germany! <br>
                    Additionally, I've formed decade-long friendships from Slovenia, India, Spain, and many more nations. <br>
                    I particularly like team-strategy games (MOBAs) where communication and competition are paramount for success. <br>

                </h2>
                <p class="body-text">Technology in all of its forms has interested me from a very early age. <br>
                    I've spent countless hours learning as much as I can on computers, screen and sound technologies, cameras, printers, etc. <br>
                    As somebody that likes to use their gadgets to breaking-point, I love the number of fields computer tech allows you to try, often for free: <br>
                    &bull; Photo editing &bull; Video editing &bull; Digital art &bull; 3D modelling &bull; Coding &bull; Server management &bull; Video-games <br>
                    All performed on the same machine. For my next passion-project I'd love to try my hand at game development.
